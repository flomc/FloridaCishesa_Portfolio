            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Tasked with improving the current data logger system used by the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana</li>
                    <li> The reservation uses the data loggers for research purposes</li>
                    <li> Data loggers are typically set up facing each other 15 ft apart</li>
                    <li> Components of the current logger are rebar, a camera trap, an audio recorder, and batteries</li>
                    <li> Current system is inefficient and laborous</li>
                    <li> Using solar panels, a voltage booster, and soldering a cutting of the components wires we were able to come up with a new system resolving many of the complications of the current one</li>
                    <li> New system components are rebar, a camera trap, an audio recorder, a solar panel pack, and a portable charger</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
            <p> We aim to address the problems below.
                <ul>
                    <li> The current system is not easy to assemble and carry </li>
                    <li> The current system is not safe from animals and bad weather</li>
                    <li> The current system requires battery maintenance </li> 
                    <li> Battery maintenance requires numerous treks to the data logger every recording period </li>
                    <li> The treks are unsafe to the researchers doing them</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>5. Process and Methodology</h2>
            <p>A description of the process followed to build the project is below:
                <ul>
                    <li> Analyzed the circuit of the camera to uncover it needs 12V of power</li>
                    <li> Analyzed the circuit of the audio component to uncover it needs 5V of power</li>
                    <li> Analyzed the power provided by the solar panel and the portable charger</li>
                    <li> Analyzed the amount of current produced by the solar panel</li>
                </ul>
            <br>Methodologies and tools used are below:
                <ul>
                    <li> Fusion 360 for design of parts</li>
                    <li> Original Prusa i3 3D printer </li>
                    <li> Soldered electronic components</li>
                </ul>
            <br>Challenges in the process faced and their solutions are outlined below:
            <ul>
                <li> Camera component needs 12V of power, but the battery only provides 5V of power</li>
                <ol> 
                    <li> We solved this problem by using a voltage booster</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The audio component was not driving enough current originally at all times originally to keep it on</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> We used a converter card in the audio component</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The solar panel needs to be at an angle and the solar panel and battery need to be a single part</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Designed a part with a cage for the battery and a 45 degree inclined platform to hold the solar panel</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The whole system needs to be held on a single rebar and the parts need to be able to be attached to the rebar</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Parts have a nut and bolt attachment that holds them stable onto the rebar</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Results</h2>
            <p> Images of our new system are below, as well as a diagram showing how all of the parts are connected electronically. This new system reinforces the water resistivity of the system, is more robust and easier to assemble, and is self-sustained through the solar panel and external portable charger eliminating the need for battery replacement mid recording periods.

            <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, we were able to design a new data logger system for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Our new design is more robust, allows for easy assembly, and eliminates the need for battery replacement throughout a data collection period. Overall, this project was a great experience to teach the importance of iteration and prioritization when it comes to prototyping. Future ideas we have for this project are to enable the data logger with a system to alert the user when there is need for maintenance with any of the parts and to expand the capabilities of the system to allow for a remote transfer of data.</p>
