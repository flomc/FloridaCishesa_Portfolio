            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> This is the end product from Design and Manufacturing I, a sophomore capstone class. The robot won a match at the competition.</li>
                    <li> This machine takes as input human input and produces electricity and can serve to power electric devices.</li>

            <h2>2. Inspiration</h2>
            <p> I wanted to design a machine that could perform the tasks of the competitions the simplest and the fastest way possible.
                <!-- <ul>
                    <li> With the currect energy crisis, we wanted to design a system that can produce clean energy with a low cost mechanical input that could be easily implemented anywhere. </li>
                    <li> This can specially help developping countries provide electricity to their population even in the most remote areas.</li>
                    
                </ul>   -->

            <h2>3. Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The main objectives of this design was  projects were to: 
                <ul>
                    <li> 1. Develop an electric generator that can highly amplify a low mechanical input</li>
                    <li> 2. Leave flexibility to the source of input to help tailor the system to any environment</li>
                    <li> 3. Keep the design relatively compact with cheap but duarble material</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>3. Process and Methodology</h2>
            <br>Methodologies and tools used:
                <ul>
                    <li> SolidWorks for design of parts</li>
                    <li> CNC milling, lathe, saws, press brake to manufacture the parts </li>
                    <li>Motors, batteries, receiver, and other electronic components </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Process:
                <ul>
                    <li> The project started with brainstorming different concepts and developing a strategy.</li>
                    <li> This was followed by designing my most critical module (MCM).  </li>
                    <li> Power analysis to perform the desired tasks with the availble resources. </li>
                    <li> Finally, working towards a finished robot, testing and iterating. </li>
                    
                </ul>

            <br>Challenges and Learning:
            <ul>
                <li> Design takes time. Starting early and testing provide a more efficent process. </li>
                <!-- <ol> 
                    <li> We solved this problem by defining a cofiguration that would minimize the distance between components. In addition, we computed the gear ratio that would achieve the same output with gears that can fit the new configuration. </li>
                </ol> -->
                <li> The rear wheels didn't have enough traction, causing slipping and skipping. </li>
                <ol>
                    <li> A counterweight was added above the rear wheels to increase traction. </li>
                </ol>

            <h2>4. Results</h2>
            <p>
                I chose a four-stage telescoping linear slide. A gear-chain of 1:2 ratio was used to deploy the lift mechanism.   
                <u>
                    <li>Two torque servos were used in this gear chain to allow both high speed and high torque.</li>
                    <li>Used delrin (high strength and stiffness, low friction and wear resistance) to manufacture pulleys and winches for minimal energy loss </li>
                    <li>Mounted a speed servo to the end of the telescoping slide, and an aluminum bar wrapped in a double-sided tape to perfom lifting and removal of tubes on the competition board. </li>
                    <li>Mounted the motor, and connected electric components for a successfull RC control</li>
                    <li>Won a match by 120 points during the competition</li>
                </u>

            <!-- <p> The electric generator successfully amplifies the input to product current. This is of 1:30 ratio between the input gear and the rotor. This device can now provide its user electric current anywhere they are without requiring too much mechanical force for input.

                    <li> Scalling up the device to produce enough current to power bigger devices</li>
                    <li> Programmig the device to produce the desirable current and volatge</li>
                    <li> Converting any input into an oscillating signal before it is transmitted to the rotor </li>
