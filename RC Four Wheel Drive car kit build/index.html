            <h2>Step 1: Component Collection</h2>
            <p> The project commenced with the collection of all necessary components. This included the ASX10II chassis, motor, ESC, servo, receiver, and body shell. Each part was chosen carefully to ensure compatibility and performance. 
            An highly organized workspace was a necessity to correctly build the car.

            <h2>8. Future Work</h2>
            <p>Future improvements and work could include the following:
                <ul>
                    <li> Add more solar panels for quicker recharge of the battery</li>
                    <li> Add a stronger portable charger with more than 5V of power</li>
                    <li> Add more durability to the system</li>
                    <li> Redesigning the reliance of the system on the rebar</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, we were able to design a new data logger system for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Our new design is more robust, allows for easy assembly, and eliminates the need for battery replacement throughout a data collection period. Overall, this project was a great experience to teach the importance of iteration and prioritization when it comes to prototyping. Future ideas we have for this project are to enable the data logger with a system to alert the user when there is need for maintenance with any of the parts and to expand the capabilities of the system to allow for a remote transfer of data.</p>
