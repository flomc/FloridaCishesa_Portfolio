            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> This is the final project from Fall 2020 Engineering Graphics</li>
                    <li> The task was to solid model any object of our choice that would meet certain criteria. </li>
                    <li> I was tasked to create an assembly in OnShape composed of at most 9 parts. </li>
                    <li> Relative motions between parts had requirements such as revolute mate and pin slot mate. </li>
                    <li>The final result had to include a detailed engineering drawing of the most complex part in the assembly.</li>
                    <li> The project had to reflect all the topics we learned throughout the quater, such as good dimensioning, tolerancing, and drawing .</li>

                    
                </ul>

            <h2>2. Inspiration</h2>
            <p> When presented with the final project instructions, I was driven not only to meet the minimum requirements but also to embark on a learning journey. I began by reflecting on my hobbies and instances where I fell short due to a lack of resources. Baking has always been a passion of mine. However, I often found myself laboriously mixing ingredients with a manual whisk, a task that an electric stand mixer could accomplish with ease. This sparked curiosity - could I create a manual stand mixer that could rival its electric counterpart in efficiency? This question ignited my creativity and became the foundation of my final project.
                <!-- <ul>
                    <li> With the currect energy crisis, we wanted to design a system that can produce clean energy with a low cost mechanical input that could be easily implemented anywhere. </li>
                    <li> This can specially help developping countries provide electricity to their population even in the most remote areas.</li>

            <h2>3. Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The main objectives of this projects were to: 
                <ul>
                    <li> 1. Develop an electric generator that can highly amplify a low mechanical input</li>
                    <li> 2. Leave flexibility to the source of input to help tailor the system to any environment</li>
                    <li> 3. Keep the design relatively compact with cheap but duarble material</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>3. Process and Methodology</h2>
            <br>Methodologies and tools used:
                <ul>
                    <li> CAD OnShape for design of parts and the assembly</li>
                    <!-- <li> Original Prusa i3 3D printer </li> -->
                </ul>
            <p>Process:
                <ul>
                    <li> The project started with brainstorming a design that would meet all the requirements for a successful project.</li>
                    <li> This was followed by breaking down the different interations between parts and thinking about the structure of each part to achieve the desired motion. </li>
                    <li> The next step was starting designing each part, and assembling them. </li>
                    <li> Finally, it was time for testing, and refining the prototype</li>

            <br>Challenges  and Learning:
            <ul>
                <li> I was constrained to 9 parts in total that could achieve all the requirements</li>
                <ol> 
                    <li> I had to think about minimize my structure of the assembly, while cretaing a product that can still work. </li>
                    
                </ol>
                <li> Keeping thrack of all the parts and interactions they have among them was necessary</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> I achieved part management by naming each action with a descriptive name such that I could easily differentiate them. </li>
                </ol>
                
            </ul>

            <!-- <p>
                Final Set Up:
                <u>
                    <li> - Six permanent magnets symmetrically positioned next to each other and constituting the rotor</li>
                    <li> - Four coils symmetrically aligned with the rotor</li>
                    <li> - A central plate where the rotor and the magnets are fermely attached </li>
                    <li> - Four gears 3D printed, two by two identical. One of the smaller gears hanging on the same shaft as the rotor</li>
                </u>
            </p>
            <p> The electric generator successfully amplifies the input to product current. This is of 1:30 ratio between the input gear and the rotor. This device can now provide its user electric current anywhere they are without requiring too much mechanical force for input.
