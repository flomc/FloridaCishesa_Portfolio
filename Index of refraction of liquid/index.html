            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The goal of this experiment is to test a method to find the index of refraction of water by using Snell‚Äôs law which is given by :
                    </li>
                    <li> n1 sin(Œ∏1)= n2sin(Œ∏2)</li>
                    <li> where n represents the index of refraction of each material, in our case is air and water. </li>
                    <li> Œ∏1 is angle of incidence and Œ∏2 is angle of refraction.</li>
                    <li> The material used included a plastic container, a laser pointer ,and water.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. First Run Procedure</h2>
            <p> About two thirds of the container were filled with water. Then the light of the beam was pointed so that it hit one side of the container to make the incident angle, then the light refracted at another side of the container.
            </p>
            <p> Different methods were used by each group member for finding multiple angle of incidence and refraction.

            <h2>6. Results</h2>
            <p> Images of our new system are below, as well as a diagram showing how all of the parts are connected electronically. This new system reinforces the water resistivity of the system, is more robust and easier to assemble, and is self-sustained through the solar panel and external portable charger eliminating the need for battery replacement mid recording periods.

            <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, we were able to design a new data logger system for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Our new design is more robust, allows for easy assembly, and eliminates the need for battery replacement throughout a data collection period. Overall, this project was a great experience to teach the importance of iteration and prioritization when it comes to prototyping. Future ideas we have for this project are to enable the data logger with a system to alert the user when there is need for maintenance with any of the parts and to expand the capabilities of the system to allow for a remote transfer of data.</p>
