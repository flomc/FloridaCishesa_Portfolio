            <h2>4. Process and Methodology</h2>
            <br>Methodologies and tools used:
                <ul>
                    <li> SolidWorks for design of parts</li>
                    <li> Original Prusa i3 3D printer </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Process:
                <ul>
                    <li> The project started with brainstorming the transmission system.</li>
                    <li> This was followed by designing the circuit and the gears in SolidWorks  </li>
                    <li> After printing, testing, and refining the prototype, the final device was assembled. </li>
                    
                </ul>

                </ul> -->
            <br>Challenges  and Learning:
            <ul>
                <li> We needed the system to stay compact and easy to assemble</li>
                <ol> 
                    <li> We solved this problem by defining a cofiguration that would minimize the distance between components. In addition, we computed the gear ratio that would achieve the same output with gears that can fit the new configuration. </li>
                </ol>
                <li> We needed to figure out the best oriantation of the rotor relative to the input, in this case, a hand turning a hinge.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> We made the central plate stand vertical with two opposetly oriented attachemnt to keep it balanced when the rotor is rotating. </li>
                </ol>
                <!-- <li> The solar panel needs to be at an angle and the solar panel and battery need to be a single part</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Designed a part with a cage for the battery and a 45 degree inclined platform to hold the solar panel</li>
                </ol>
                <li> The whole system needs to be held on a single rebar and the parts need to be able to be attached to the rebar</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Parts have a nut and bolt attachment that holds them stable onto the rebar</li>
                </ol> -->

            <h2>5. Results and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Final Set Up:
                <u>
                    <li> - Six permanent magnets symmetrically positioned next to each other and constituting the rotor</li>
                    <li> - Four coils symmetrically aligned with the rotor</li>
                    <li> - A central plate where the rotor and the magnets are fermely attached </li>
                    <li> - Four gears 3D printed, two by two identical. One of the smaller gears hanging on the same shaft as the rotor</li>
                </u>
            </p>
            <p> The electric generator successfully amplifies the input to product current. This is of 1:30 ratio between the input gear and the rotor. This device can now provide its user electric current anywhere they are without requiring too much mechanical force for input.

            <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, we were able to design a new data logger system for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Our new design is more robust, allows for easy assembly, and eliminates the need for battery replacement throughout a data collection period. Overall, this project was a great experience to teach the importance of iteration and prioritization when it comes to prototyping. Future ideas we have for this project are to enable the data logger with a system to alert the user when there is need for maintenance with any of the parts and to expand the capabilities of the system to allow for a remote transfer of data.</p>
