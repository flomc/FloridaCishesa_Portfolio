            <h2>2. Inspiration</h2>
            <p> We aim to address the problems below.
                <ul>
                    <li> With the currect energy crisis, we wanted to design a system that can produce clean energy with a low cost mechanical input that could be easily implemented anywhere. </li>
                    <li> This can specially help developping countries provide electricity to their population even in the most remote areas.</li>

            <h2>3. Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The main objectives of this projects were to: 
                <ul>
                    <li> 1. Develop an electric generator that can highly amplify a low mechanical input</li>
                    <li> 2. Leave flexibility to the source of input to help tailor the system to any environment</li>
                    <li> 3. Keep the design relatively compact with cheap but duarble material</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>4. Process and Methodology</h2>
            <br>Methodologies and tools used:
                <ul>
                    <li> SolidWorks for design of parts</li>
                    <li> Original Prusa i3 3D printer </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Process:
                <ul>
                    <li> The project started with brainstorming the transmission system.</li>
                    <li> This was followed by designing the circuit and the gears in SolidWorks  </li>
                    <li> After printing, testing, and refining the prototype, the final device was assembled. </li>
                    
                </ul>

            <br>Challenges  and Learning:
            <ul>
                <li> We needed the system to stay compact and easy to assemble</li>
                <ol> 
                    <li> We solved this problem by defining a cofiguration that would minimize the distance between components. In addition, we computed the gear ratio that would achieve the same output with gears that can fit the new configuration. </li>
                </ol>
                <li> We needed to figure out the best oriantation of the rotor relative to the input, in this case, a hand turning a hinge.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> We made the central plate stand vertical with two opposetly oriented attachemnt to keep it balanced when the rotor is rotating. </li>
                </ol>
                
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Results and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Final Set Up:
                <u>
                    <li> - Six permanent magnets symmetrically positioned next to each other and constituting the rotor</li>
                    <li> - Four coils symmetrically aligned with the rotor</li>
                    <li> - A central plate where the rotor and the magnets are fermely attached </li>
                    <li> - Four gears 3D printed, two by two identical. One of the smaller gears hanging on the same shaft as the rotor</li>
                </u>
            </p>
            <p> The electric generator successfully amplifies the input to product current. This is of 1:30 ratio between the input gear and the rotor. This device can now provide its user electric current anywhere they are without requiring too much mechanical force for input.

            <p>Plans for the future include:
                <ul>
                    <li> Scalling up the device to produce enough current to power bigger devices</li>
                    <li> Programmig the device to produce the desirable current and volatge</li>
                    <li> Converting any input into an oscillating signal before it is transmitted to the rotor </li>
                    <!-- <li> Redesigning the reliance of the system on the rebar</li> -->
                </ul>
